# yayagf
yet another yet another go web framework

## what to use

### philosophy

Everything I write is just stealing from rails.

### agile

web development should be very agile, from db to web page, use more tools, care less on dirty work.

what you need is only an editor (i use emacs!) and a terminal.

### spa

should serve spa with better router.

### devops

I like to make everything in pipeline monitoring. devops is really a good thing, especially with golang.

### json

web framework serves page, but now backend serves json as view layer more.

care more on json schema and go template is stupid.

### performance

web framework should not treat the performance very important.

go is fast, so performance is not a really big thing.

## how to use

### yayagf new

### yayagf server

monitor the code, recompile the code when compilable and run.
