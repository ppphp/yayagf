# yayagf
yet another yet another go web framework

## install

`go install ./cmd/yayagf`

## what to use

Everything I write is just stealing from rails.

### performance

web framework should not treat the performance very important.

go is fast, so performance is not a really big thing.

## how to use

### yayagf new

type `yayagf new gitlab.papegames.com/fengche/abc` will generate a folder with abc

### yayagf server

go into any go project 

`yayagf server` will monitor the code, recompile the code when compilable and run.

### yayagf generate

it should take the advantage of gin and go-micro, but they are not the perfect tool.
